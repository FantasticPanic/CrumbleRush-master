#Crumble Rush

This game operates very similarly to the mobile game, Zig Zag if you have ever played it before. If you have then, my game is almost like that, except it doesn't have any intrusive ads and the scoring system works a bit differently (you earn points based on how long you survive, rather than how many times you switch directions).
